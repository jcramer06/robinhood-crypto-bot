# robinhood-crypto-bot
AI and machine learning powered cryptocurrency trading bot utilizing the Robinhood crypto API.

Project plans:
	• Trade crypto with some success
 	• Use sentiment analysis and web scrape to produce some coefficient that will be used in managing trading risk.
 	• Implement various trading strategies and analyze them
	• Design elegant graphs, charts, and plots of trading data and results
 	• Use various regression models to form short and long-term 'predictions'
  	• Navigate risk and not lose all my money
   	• Experiment with other ML models as fit
    	• Add a neural network for trading
•PLANS 6/12/25
	• Add more standard analysis tools to be used as neural network input
 	• Greatly increase accuracy, currently stuck in low-reward loop
	• Develop a more robust sentiment analysis system
 	• Possibly implement double deep q learning
  	• Experiment with more variance as a means to counteract market volatility
   	• add incentives for holding over time without training model to only hold
    	• prevent model from choosing same action continuously with exponentially large negative reward
